# IntroToArrays
My first ever program back in high school when I first learnt about arrays as well as methods. Here just to showcase one of my final unit projects regarding arrays.

## How to run code
For this code to work, drag and drop the .java file into any java programming compiler, the code for us was written on a software called Eclipse.
And that's it! No really. That's it. Now all you gotta do is run the code, find a friend to play with and enjoy.

## Eclipse
This program was coded on Eclipse, to download Eclipse, visit : https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/ and download their latest release on your compatible device.
